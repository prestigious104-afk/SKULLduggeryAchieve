<h1>&nbsp; About Collections</h1>
	<p> The collection comprises of skulls of humans that have lived on...
	The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate 
	existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the 
	same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their 
	pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a 
	new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay 
	expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have 
	uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several 
	languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more 
	simple and regular than that of the individual languages.<br>
