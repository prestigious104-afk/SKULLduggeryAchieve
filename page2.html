	<h2>Morse Code with Ludwig Van Beethoven</h2>
		<p>The European languages are members of the same family. 
		Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, 
		sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages 
		only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their 
		most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common 
		language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay 
		expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary 
		to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.
