<h2 align=center>Noggin Programs</h2>

	<h3>&nbsp; Skull Painting</h3>
		<p>The European languages are members of the same family. 
		Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, 
		sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages 
		only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their 
		most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common 
		language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay 
		expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary 
		to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Times: Mondays and Thursdays&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 - 8 pm</i>

<h2 align=center>Onboarding Process</h2>

	<h3 align=center>Step 1: <i>Die</i></h3>
	<p align=center>&nbsp; &nbsp; It doesn't have to be fancy. A life well lived, isn't a requirement. Just interesting 
	enough to <br> get our curator's attention. <i>Being extra cruel or extra kind makes no difference.</i></p>
	<h3 align=center>Step 2: <i>That's it</i></h3>
	<p align=center>Welcome to the family. You are not allowed to leave... Ever!</p>
